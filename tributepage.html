<h3>About Mark Lee:</h3>
<p id = "tribute-info">Mark Lee <strong>(Korean Name: Lee Minhyung) (born August 2nd, 1999)</strong> is a Canadian-Korean rapper/singer/songwriter who is known for being part of the kpop boy group NCT, a group with unlimited members. He was born in Toronto, Ontario before moving to Vancouver, BC at a very young age. Among the four established units of NCT, Mark debuted in three of them, making him the member in the most units until December 2018, when he graduated from NCT Dream, a subunit you stay in until you turn twenty years old. In August 2019, he was confirmed to join SuperM, a super boy group with his fellow band members and artists from veteran groups, EXO and SHINee, who target the American music industry. <br> <br> Mark contributes to creating their albums, being credited for writing most songs and his own verses. He was also the unofficial leader of NCT Dream, guiding his younger brothers and leading the fanchant "Yo Dream!". Mark is known for being SM Entertainment's best rapper, changing the public's opinion on their lack of rappers, the demand of rappers grew rapidly as huge kpop groups like BTS and GOT7 have multiple talented rappers. Maybe that is why he debuted four times in under three years, he is that good at what he does.</p>
