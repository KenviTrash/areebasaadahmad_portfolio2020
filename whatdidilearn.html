<h1>What Did I Learn in ICS4U</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png" width = "250">
        <ul>
            <li>After Adobe and C++, JavaScript is the next level after the two, combining features from each program together into JavaScript. I learned JavaScript well through working on the summatives and the modules prepared on this website. Using previous knowledge and the skills we learned this year, I learned quite a lot about JavaScript and how to run it properly on Khan Academy, Glitch and p5.js.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>

        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg" width = "200">
        <ul>
            <li>I started learning HTML through Khan Academy and Free Code Camp and learned multiple things about setting up a webpage (with doctype and opening and closing code) and using elements to create a suffient website. I used a lot of HTML on this website to get it together. As for CSS, I approached it with the previous knowledge of HTML and used it on some factors of my website (from the gradient background to the coloured text). I would say I learned HTML/CSS very well throughout the course.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Glitch/p5.js</li>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/Glitch_%28company%29_logo.svg/1200px-Glitch_%28company%29_logo.svg.png" width = "250">
        <img src = "https://p5js.org/assets/img/p5js.svg" width = "250">
        <ul>
            <li>When the hackathon was assigned, my group turned towards Glitch, a free coding website and coded a complex program (Study Bunny) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Glitch made learning how to combine the three easier to comprehend. As for p5.js, which we used for the coding train summative, was also easy to use for beginners. It was separated into bits (one js, one html, one css file) and it was preset so you could work around it. Using Glitch and p5.js editor worked really well in expanding my understanding in those three programs.</li>
