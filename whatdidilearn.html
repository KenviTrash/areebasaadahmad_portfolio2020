<h1>What Did I Learn in ICS4U</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>After Adobe and C++, JavaScript is the next level after the two, combining features from each program together into JavaScript. I learned JavaScript well through working on the summatives and the modules prepared on this website. Using previous knowledge and the skills we learned this year, I learned quite a lot about JavaScript and how to run it properly on Khan Academy, Glitch and p5.js</li>
        </ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
