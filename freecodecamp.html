<h1>Free Code Camp</h1>
  <p>I got most of the certificates needed in FreeCodeCamp and I want to present one module in the web responsive design certification, the tribute page.</p>
  <p><a href="https://kenvitrash.github.io/areebasaadahmad_portfolio2020/tributepage.html">Tribute Webpage</a></p>
  <p>Explanation: My tribute page is towards Mark Lee, one of my favourite rappers currently. I used CSS elements to colour different elements (h1 is blue, h5 is green) and I sectioned off a quote, an introductory paragraph and a timeline of his achievements and debuts.</p>
