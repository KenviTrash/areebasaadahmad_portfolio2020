  <h1>Khan Academy</h1>
  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
  <p>When I went through Khan Academy, I struggled at first to understand the concepts and finish the assignments and projects. Eventually, I took my time to decipher each concept Khan Academy was trying to teach me and came up with great results and a good understanding at the end.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In the list below, there are a list of modules I completed from each mandatory section from Khan Academy. Click each link to go to the code and a brief explanation is below.</p>
  <h3>Mandatory Modules:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Algorithms</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Recursive Art</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Introduction to Javascript</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-make-it-rain/5405895560232960">Make It Rain</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Make It Rain took me a while to understand, checking multiple times in previous lessons to guide me to completing it. Instead of a single drop, that was preset, I added more drops by adding multiple x and y positions within the arrays. The colour was changed into a darker blue and it dropped in different times.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-shooting-star/6147834480394240">Shooting Star</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Shooting Star was pretty difficult to understand at first then I got it as soon as I looked back into the lessons. I did a setup of a car driving back home in the night, with streetlamps and everything. Two stars, from different places cross each other as it moves across the canvas. The use of if statements and shapes were used efficiently.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/logic-if-statements/pp/project-magic-8-ball">Magic 8 Ball</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Magic 8 Ball was easy to understand, using if statements and shapes to determine how to solve it. I used a random variable to generate different results every time you press the restart button on Khan Academy. The colours change along with the answers and the text was formatted to fit each square.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-animal-attack/5287853576650752">Animal Attack</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Animal Attack was rather simplistic, I chose to create a caterpillar out of ellipses. I set an x and y variable to set a base ellipse and repeated steps to make the parts of the caterpillar. I made my animal move as well, going up the canvas until it disappears.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Introduction to HTML/CSS</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://kenvitrash.github.io/areebasaadahmad_portfolio2020/recipe.html">Recipe Book</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>I chose to create a recipe book, using some of the food I know how to make with my mum. They are rather simplistic dishes but the use of CSS and HTML was effective. There is a table of contents to jump to each recipe and there is blocking and text alignment to make the format look like an actual recipe book.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://kenvitrash.github.io/areebasaadahmad_portfolio2020/travelwebsite.html">Travel Website</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</li>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-paint-splatter/5268669255876608">Paint Splatter</a></li>
