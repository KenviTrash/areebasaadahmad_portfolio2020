<h1>ISU4U Summative: The Coding Train</h1>
<img src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/18553964?s=400&v=4" height="200">
<p>For the course summative, we turned to Daniel Shiffman to observe his code and make our own creative refactoring to show our learning of code.</p>
<p>My group covered the cardioid visualization, which uses the two time tables to create a visualization that spins.</p>
<p>Through the summative presentations, I learned how to use different factors to make a game, design or a visualization. Another creative refactoring I did was for the snake game, that used multiple Javascript files to build a snake and transport the goal around the screen.</p>
<h3><a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/asaad127/sketches/rXBP00LoG">Cardioid Visualization</a></h3>
<p>What I changed in this refactoring is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>used if statements to change the colour of the visualization in certain increments, when colorR reaches 255, it will reverse</li>
        <li>used sliders (learned from a peer's summative presentation) to increase the speed of the visualization (compared to my presentation, I increased the speed significantly).</li>
    </ul>
<h3><a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/asaad127/sketches/eesbeKgjF">Snake Game</a></h3>
<p>What I changed in this refactoring is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>everytime the snake eats a tuna, it will do two things: change colour (the rgb values increase a different amount) and make the snake go faster and bump into walls</li>
    </ul>
