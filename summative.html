<h1>ISU4U Summative: The Coding Train</h1>

<p>For the course summative, we turned to Daniel Shiffman to observe his code and make our own creative refactoring to show our learning of code.</p>
<p>My group covered the cardioid visualization, which uses the two time tables to create a visualization that spins.</p>
<p>Through the summative presentations, I learned how to use different factors to make a game, design or a visualization. Another creative refactoring I did was for the snake game, that used multiple Javascript files to build a snake and transport the goal around the screen.</p>
